# Celestial Object Identifier

## This software uses advanced mechanisms to identify celestial objects in the night sky. It leverages libraries like cv2, numpy, and matplotlib to manage and accurately process the data. The software receives data from NASA's API, specifically the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) to obtain relevant images for analysis.

## To test the software, run the ImageAnalyzer module using the Python 3 interpreter and input the desired date for analysis based on the APOD data.

## The AstroPy library can be utilized to obtain information about visible stars, and image processing techniques can then be applied to identify their positions in the sky. This program can serve as a useful tool for amateur astronomers to easily identify celestial objects in the night sky.

> :warning: Please note that the project is still under development and has been created for the purpose of studying celestial bodies and the libraries mentioned above.
